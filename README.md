Steps to get started with the Deakin Energy Application

clone the repository using the link from Github

Change directory to the project folder.

In your command prompt, type "install" + Enter { This would run the bat file to create the virtual environment and activate it }

Run " pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the essential packages required to run the application.

TIP : Always work on the DEVELOPMENT branch and do not push changes to dev branch(which is like our master branch) directly.
